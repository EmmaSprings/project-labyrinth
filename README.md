# Project Labyrinth

In this group project, we fetch data from API and store it in our Redux store while practicing working in a dev team.

Users should be able to:

- view the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size.
- see the hover effect when hovering over each button
- enjoy the game! 

## The problem

The biggest problem that we had was the restart button.
We explored options to create unique id for usernames but dropped that as the end as we see that there're benefits of not being able to reuse a username (for instance, testing purposes).
